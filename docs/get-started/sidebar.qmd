title: Sidebar navigation

quartodoc can generate a sidebar on the lefthand side of the page, with a list of your functions.

In order to create a sidebar for your docs, add the following options to your `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
# tell quarto to read the sidebar file
metadata-files:
  - _sidebar.yml


# tell quartodoc to generate the sidebar file
quartodoc:
  sidebar: "_sidebar.yml"
  # other options ...
```

Note that running `python -m quartodoc build` will now produce a file called `_sidebar.yml`,
with a [Quarto sidebar configuration](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html#side-navigation).
The Quarto [`metadata-files` option](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#metadata-includes) ensures
it's included with the configuration in `_quarto.yml`.

Additional [sidebar options are available in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html#side-navigation) and can be passed from quartodoc to Quarto via `sidebar_options`:

```yaml
quartodoc:
  sidebar: "_sidebar.yml"
  sidebar_options:
    style: docked
    search: true
    collapse-level: 2
```

Here is what the sidebar for the [quartodoc reference page](/api) looks like:

<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode yaml"><code class="sourceCode yaml">{{< include /api/_sidebar.yml >}}
</code></pre>
</div>
